## Project Overview

The Mars Exploration Project is designed to provide insights into Mars-related news and weather patterns. This project demonstrates web scraping and data analysis techniques using Python.

---

## Insights

### Minimum Temperature
- Martian temperatures are extremely cold, with slight variations across months.
- The eighth month is the warmest, with an average minimum temperature of -68°C.
  



### Atmospheric Pressure
- Atmospheric pressure peaks in the ninth month and is lowest during the fifth and sixth months.
- Pressure correlates with temperature, increasing during warmer months.
  



### Martian Year Length
- A visual analysis of temperature patterns suggests a Martian year lasts approximately 700 Earth days.

## Files

### Part 1: Mars News (`part_1_mars_news.ipynb`)
- Scrapes the latest Mars-related news articles from a designated source.
- Extracts titles, summaries, and other relevant details for further analysis.
- Displays the news in a clean and organized format.

### Part 2: Mars Weather (`part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`)
- Focuses on collecting and analyzing weather data from Mars.
- Visualizes temperature patterns, atmospheric pressure, and other key metrics.
- Provides insights into the Martian climate over time.
